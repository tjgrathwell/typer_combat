# Typer Combat

A game about a little guy who runs around and shoots at word-enemies.

## Running

Typer Combat is written in Python 2.x using [pygame](http://pygame.org/), so you can theoretically install it on any platform, provided you can get pygame running.

### OSX

Here's one of the many possible ways you might achieve success:

Install Python 2.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the latest pygame from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Launch the game with a command like this:
